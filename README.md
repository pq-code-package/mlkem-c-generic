** THIS REPO IS ARCHIVED **

This repository was originally conceived to support an implementation based on the [PQCrystals ML-KEM](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber) code.

As the team have discussed how to best provide a supported standard implementation, we have now decided to focus our efforts on broadening the scope of the [mlkem-c-aarch64](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64) implementation to support multiple architectures. That repo will be [renamed](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/105) shortly.

As such, activity in this repo will not continue.
